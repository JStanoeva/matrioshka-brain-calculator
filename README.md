# 🧠 Matrioshka Brain Calculator

**Matrioshka Brain Calculator** is a sleek, interactive web app designed to model and calculate the radius of a theoretical megastructure known as a **Matrioshka Brain**—a layered shellworld of computational Dyson shells orbiting a star.

This is a science-themed React project focused on stellar physics, thermodynamic efficiency, and data visualization. It allows users to input astrophysical parameters, adjust architectural factors, and view the resulting shell structure in real-time.

## ⚙️ What Can You Do?

- Simulate **Dyson shell layers** based on stellar mass, radius, temperature, or direct luminosity
- Control **radiative properties** (α and ε) of the megastructure
- Adjust **architectural ratios** like radius growth (fr) and thermal dropoff (fT)
- Choose between **termination criteria** (target outer temp or layer count)
- Toggle **optional thermodynamic outputs**:
  - Carnot efficiency (η)
  - Landauer limit energy per bit
  - Per-layer exergy potential
